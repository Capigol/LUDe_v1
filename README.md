ðŸ“ŒAbout Us

We are a drug discovery team with an interest in the development of publicly available open-source customizable cheminformatics tools
to be used in computer-assisted drug discovery. We belong to the Laboratory of Bioactive Research and Development (LIDeB) of the
National University of La Plata (UNLP), Argentina. Our research group is focused on computer-guided drug repurposing and rational discovery
of new drug candidates to treat epilepsy and neglected tropical diseases.

**LUDe WebApp**

LUDe (LIDEBâ€™s Useful Decoys) is WebApp that generates, from a set of active compounds, decoys (putative inactive compounds)
which can be used to retrospectively validate virtual screening tool/protocols. Decoys are molecules that have not been tested
against a molecular target of interest but due to their structural features are presumably not prone to bind the target with high affinity.
LUDe finds decoys in a curated ChEMBL27 database which are paired with the known active compounds in relation to certain general
physicochemical properties (e.g., molecular weight, log P, and others) but which are topologically different from the query compounds.
LUDe is conceptually similar to the Directory of Useful Decoys enhanced, but additional filters have been serially implemented
to assure the topological dissimilarity between the decoys and the active compounds.

In this WebApp, decoys are obtained by four sequential steps:

1) Searching molecules with similar physicochemical properties of the loaded molecules in a curated ChEMBL database.
2) Filtering the selected molecules by dissimilarity against each individual loaded molecule.
3) Randomly selecting a desired number of decoys for each individual loaded molecule.
4) Filtering the selected molecules by the dissimilarity against all the loaded molecules. Finally, you can download a file with your decoys.
